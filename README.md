# giant-snes-gamepad #


This project aims to build a Giant Super Nintendo Gamepad USB
gamepad. This repository will aim to host all instructions and how to
build and use it, as well as source code.

The idea is to construct a foot step platform were two people have to
play cooperatively on one gamepad.
